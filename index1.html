    <div class="text4"> <i> Jesus Christ is the central figure of Christianity and is believed by Christians to be the Son of God and the
    Savior of the world. His life, teachings, death, and resurrection are the foundation of the Christian faith.</i></div>

    <div class="text3"><b> Get to know Jesus</b></div></div>
<div class="element"></div>
<div class="text5"><b>His Birth and Early Life</b>-
Jesus was born in Bethlehem to the Virgin Mary, fulfilling Old Testament prophecies about the coming of the Messiah (Matthew 1:18-25, Luke 2:1-20).
His birth is celebrated as Christmas.
He grew up in Nazareth and worked as a carpenter before beginning His ministry.</div>


<div class="text6"><b>His Teachings and Miracles</b>-Around the age of 30, Jesus began His public ministry, preaching about God’s Kingdom, love, forgiveness, and salvation.
He performed many miracles, such as healing the sick, raising the dead, feeding thousands, calming storms, and casting out demons (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John).
He taught using parables (short stories with deep spiritual meanings), like the Parable of the Good Samaritan and the Parable of the Prodigal Son. </div>


<div class="text7"><b> His Death and Sacrifice</b>-Jesus was falsely accused by religious leaders and sentenced to death by crucifixion under the Roman governor Pontius Pilate.
His crucifixion took place on Good Friday, and He died to pay for the sins of humanity (Isaiah 53:5, John 19:30).
He was buried in a tomb, and His followers thought all hope was lost.</div>


<div class="text8"><b>His Resurrection and Victory</b>-On the third day (Easter Sunday), Jesus rose from the dead, proving His power over sin and death (Luke 24:6-7).
He appeared to His disciples and many others before ascending to heaven, promising to return one day (Acts 1:9-11).</div>


<div class="text9"><b>His Message and Salvation</b>-Jesus offers forgiveness, grace, and eternal life to all who believe in Him (John 3:16).
His death and resurrection mean that anyone who accepts Him as Lord and Savior will be saved (Romans 10:9).
He taught that the greatest commandment is to love God and love others (Matthew 22:37-39).</div>

<div class="text10"><b>His Second Coming</b>-The Bible teaches that Jesus will return one day to establish His kingdom and judge the world (Revelation 22:12).</div>

        <div class="text">"For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord."


            <div class="text"><li><b>Isaiah 40:28-31 </b></li>
  <div class="text">"Do you not know? Have you not heard?
The Lord is the everlasting God,
the Creator of the ends of the earth.
He will not grow tired or weary,
and his understanding no one can fathom.

He gives strength to the weary
and increases the power of the weak.

Even youths grow tired and weary,
and young men stumble and fall;

but those who hope in the Lord
will renew their strength.
They will soar on wings like eagles;
they will run and not grow weary,
they will walk and not be faint."</div>

    <div class=""><div class="text"></div><li><b>Psalm 91:1-4 </b></li></div>
    <div class="text">"Whoever dwells in the shelter of the Most High
will rest in the shadow of the Almighty.

I will say of the Lord, 'He is my refuge and my fortress,
my God, in whom I trust.'

Surely he will save you from the fowler’s snare
and from the deadly pestilence.
He will cover you with his feathers,
and under his wings you will find refuge;
his faithfulness will be your shield and rampart."</div>
